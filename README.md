## **Predicting live-birth occurrence before in-vitro fertilization treatment**
### **Background**
Infertility is a global health issue and is estimated to affect 48.5 million couples worldwide. For this reason, the demand for in vitro fertilization (IVF) is increasing with over 2.5 million cycles being performed every year, resulting in over 500,000 deliveries annually. However, the whole process of IVF treatment is very time consuming and very expensive with no guarantee of success. Given the consequences, a tool to predict the probability of a successful live birth before an IVF treatment is importantly needed for patients' counseling and shaping their expectations about the treatment outcome. 
### **Objectives**
* Main objective of this task is to predict the live-birth occurence before in-vitro fertilization treatment.
* Methods that we use in this task is Decision Tree.
